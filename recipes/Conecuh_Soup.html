    <h1>Conecuh Soup</h1>
    <img src="./image/Conecuh Soup.jpg">
    <p><strong>Discription</strong>This Conecuh soup, made with Conecuh smoked pork sausage, is a perfect food that I bring to gatherings. It's great with cornbread, and feel free to dress it with cheese and sour cream. Final note, it is brand specific. I tried not using Bush’s black eyed peas, and it didn’t work—also my grandmother will turn over in her grave if you use a knockoff.<br></p>
    <p><em>ingredients</em>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package Conecuh® pork sausage, any flavor, cut into 1-inch bites</li>
        <li>1 (10-ounce) can Ro*Tel® diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, undrained</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet Lipton® beefy onion soup</li>
        <li>4 (15.8 ounce) cans Bush's® black eyed peas, undrained</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Steps</em>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sausage, diced tomatoes and green chiles, beefy onion soup mix, and black eyed peas in a Dutch oven or a slow cooker</li>
        <li>Set Dutch oven over low heat on the stove (slow cooker set to Low), and cook until fully heated through, about 30 minutes (4 hours in the slow cooker)</li>
    </ol>
